# Credit Card Fraud Management System

## Overview

Welcome to the Credit Card Fraud Management System repository! This project utilizes a variety of machine learning techniques to detect and manage credit card fraud efficiently. It is designed to handle a large dataset of credit card transactions, applying data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling to identify fraudulent activities.

## Features

- **Data Handling:** Robust loading and displaying of large-scale datasets.
- **Data Analysis:** Comprehensive exploratory data analysis with statistical summaries and correlation matrices.
- **Preprocessing:** Implements preprocessing steps like scaling and encoding to prepare data for modeling.
- **Model Training:** Utilizes multiple machine learning models for accurate fraud detection.
- **Model Evaluation:** Detailed evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
- **Data Serialization:** Features for saving and loading model configurations and results for future use.

## Repository Structure

- **main.py:** The main Python script containing all the project code.
- **data/:** Directory containing the dataset files.
- **models/:** Saved machine learning models and configuration files.
- **notebooks/:** Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and visualizations.
- **output/:** Output files including logs and model performance metrics.
